Personal finance involves managing your money wisely to achieve financial stability and goals. 
It includes budgeting, saving, investing, and planning for retirement. Creating a monthly budget
helps you track income and expenses effectively. Saving regularly builds an emergency fund for unexpected events.
Investing allows your money to grow over time through assets like stocks or real estate. Understanding credit and 
debt management is essential to avoid financial pitfalls. Personal finance also includes setting both short-term 
and long-term financial goals, such as buying a home or funding education expenses.
